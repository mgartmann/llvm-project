misc-std-stream-objects-outside-main
=============

Diagnoses if a predefined standard stream object (``cin``, ``wcin``,
``cout``, ``wcout``, ``cerr`` or ``wcerr``) is used outside the ``main`` function.

For instance, in the following code, the use of ``std::cout`` outside of ``main()`` would get
flagged whereas the use of ``std::cout`` inside ``main()`` is not flagged:

.. code-block:: c++

  #include <iostream>

  void some_function() {
    std::cout << "This triggers the check.";
         ~~~~
  }

  int main() {
    std::cout << "This does not trigger the check.";
  }

Since the predefined standard stream objects are global objects, their use outside of ``main()`` worsens a
program's testability and is thus discouraged. Instead, those objects should only be used inside ``main()``.
They can then be passed as arguments to other functions like so:

.. code-block:: c++

  #include <iostream>

  void some_function(std::istream & in, std::ostream & out) {
    out << "This does not trigger the check.";

    int i{0};
    in >> i;
  }

  int main() {
    some_function(std::cin, std::cout);
  }

In contrast to using ``std::cin`` and ``std::cout`` directly, in the above example, it is possible to inject 
mocked stream objects into ``some_function()`` during testing.
